# Autonomous-Bullet-Casing-Collector
Rutgers University | Industrial and Systems Engineering | Fall 2017 Capstone Project

"AnnotatedPythonProgram.py"
Developed by my teammates and me
Covers the following:
- Image capture and item detetection
- Translation of node detection to optimal travel path
- Communication of movements (linear and rotational) to arduino board (and eventually mechanical components)

"tsp_custom.py"; TSP = Travelling Sales Person optimal path algorithm
Developed by my teammates and me with the help of an advisor
- consumes x,y coordinates passed by "AnnotatedPythonProgram.py"
- outputs path to visit all coordinates
